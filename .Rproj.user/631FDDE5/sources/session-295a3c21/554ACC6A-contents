abstract: "This paper forecasts the 2024 US Presidential election outcome using polling data from [insert pollster name]. By applying simple and multiple linear regression models, we analyze the effect of polling factors, including sample size, poll score, and transparency, on support percentages for key candidates. Our findings suggest significant relationships between these variables, providing an evidence-based approach to predicting election outcomes. We further explore methodological strengths and weaknesses and propose an ideal polling survey methodology. This work highlights the potential for data-driven insights into political forecasting."

## Measurement
	
Some paragraphs about how we go from a phenomena in the world to an entry in the dataset.

## Outcome variables

Add graphs, tables and text. Use sub-sub-headings for each outcome variable or update the subheading to be singular.



Some of our data is of penguins (@fig-bills), from[]. 
```{r}
#| label: fig-bills
#| fig-cap: Bills of penguins
#| echo: false


```

Talk more about it.

And also planes (@fig-planes). (You can change the height and width, but don't worry about doing that until you have finished every other aspect of the paper - Quarto will try to make it look nice and the defaults usually work well once you have enough text.)

```{r}
#| label: fig-planes

```

Talk way more about it. 

## Predictor variables

Add graphs, tables and text.

Use sub-sub-headings for each outcome variable and feel free to combine a few into one if they go together naturally.








# Model {#sec-data}

The goal of our modelling strategy is twofold. Firstly,...

Here we briefly describe the Bayesian analysis model used to investigate... Background details and diagnostics are included in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].

## Model set-up

Define $y_i$ as the number of seconds that the plane remained aloft. Then $\beta_i$ is the wing width and $\gamma_i$ is the wing length, both measured in millimeters.  

\begin{align} 
y_i|\mu_i, \sigma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + \beta_i + \gamma_i\\
\alpha &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\gamma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\sigma &\sim \mbox{Exponential}(1)
\end{align}

We run the model in R [@citeR] using the `rstanarm` package of @rstanarm. We use the default priors from `rstanarm`.


### Model justification

We expect a positive relationship between the size of the wings and time spent aloft. In particular...

We can use maths by including latex between dollar signs, for instance $\theta$.

## Appendix A: Methodology Overview and Evaluation of YouGov Polling

### Introduction
YouGov is an online polling company that uses a combination of non-probability sampling and a model known as multilevel regression with post-stratification (MRP) to estimate voter intentions. This appendix reviews YouGov’s approach, including sample recruitment, data collection, response handling, questionnaire design, and MRP modeling. It also assesses the strengths and limitations of YouGov’s methods.

### Population, Frame, and Sample Composition
YouGov’s target population for its election polling includes American adults, with a focus on registered voters. It uses an online panel as its frame, drawing participants from a pool of volunteers who sign up and provide demographic information. This setup allows YouGov to adjust samples to align with the population it seeks to represent. Additionally, YouGov uses the TargetSmart voter file to verify that the sample aligns with national voter demographics. During election periods, YouGov increases its sample size, beginning with nearly 100,000 responses and adding another 20,000 in September and October to update its model.

### Sample Recruitment and Representativeness
YouGov recruits panel members online through ads and partnerships with other websites. This approach allows any American adult with internet access to join. Members provide basic demographic information, which YouGov uses to select participants and apply statistical weighting to reflect the population accurately. Panelists earn points for participating, redeemable for small rewards, which encourages engagement and enhances data quality. However, since recruitment is internet-based, some groups without reliable internet access, such as rural or low-income populations, may be underrepresented.

### Sampling Approach and Methodological Trade-offs
YouGov’s approach involves non-probability sampling, meaning that not everyone in the population has an equal chance of being selected. To address this, YouGov applies the MRP model, dividing respondents into subgroups based on characteristics like age, gender, race, education, region, and political affiliation. Each subgroup is weighted to match its share in the population. This method is efficient but has trade-offs, as MRP may not fully capture smaller states or hard-to-reach groups.

### Non-response Handling and Quality Control Measures
YouGov uses strict quality control measures to manage non-response. Surveys include checks for speed and consistency, removing low-quality responses. Panelists who repeatedly fail these checks are excluded, helping to reduce bias and improve data quality. These quality controls are essential for the MRP model, which relies on accurate data to produce reliable estimates.

### Questionnaire Design
YouGov’s questionnaires are neutral and straightforward, with randomized question order to reduce bias. They include various question types, such as text, images, and audio, helping respondents understand the context. Options like “prefer not to say” are included for sensitive questions, supporting respondent privacy. However, since the surveys are conducted online, some groups without internet access may be excluded, and shorter questionnaires may limit the depth of data collected.

### MRP Model for Vote Estimation
YouGov’s MRP model estimates voter intentions through three stages: estimating likelihood to vote, predicting support for a candidate among likely voters, and aggregating results to calculate overall support. By matching responses to the TargetSmart voter file, the model generates estimates at both national and regional levels. The MRP model also helps YouGov track changes in voter intentions over time.

### Strengths and Limitations of the YouGov Approach
YouGov’s approach has several strengths. The MRP model allows for accurate predictions at regional and national levels, and the use of voter files enhances sample representativeness. Repeated interviews with panelists allow YouGov to observe shifts in voter intentions over time. However, limitations include potential representativeness issues due to non-probability sampling, particularly in small states and among underrepresented groups. The internet-based survey method also may not fully capture populations without reliable internet access.

### Conclusion
Through a combination of MRP modeling, quality control, and a large online panel, YouGov provides a structured approach for election polling. Although challenges remain in achieving full representativeness and internet coverage, YouGov’s approach offers useful information on U.S. voter intentions. The MRP model has proven effective in past elections and serves as a practical tool for future polling and tracking trends.


## Appendix B: Idealized Survey Methodology

### Introduction

The budget for this survey is $100,000, aimed at predicting the outcome of the 2024 United States Presidential Election. This methodology includes stratified sampling, multi-platform recruitment, data validation, and multi-wave data aggregation to ensure representative and reliable data.

### Sampling Approach: Stratified Random Sampling

To obtain a representative sample, we use stratified random sampling with a sample size of 5,000 respondents. Sampling is stratified by age, gender, education, and geographic region to ensure broad coverage across voter demographics. The age groups include 18-29, 30-44, 45-64, and 65 and above. Gender is categorized as male, female, and other, while education is classified as high school or below, bachelor’s degree, and master’s degree or above. The geographic region includes all U.S. states. Stratified sampling ensures that the sample accurately reflects voter characteristics, providing a solid foundation for subsequent analysis.

### Recruitment: Multi-Platform and Interactive Engagement

Recruitment is conducted through a multi-platform strategy to ensure wide coverage among voters. Targeted ads are deployed on Google, Facebook, and Twitter to attract respondents with specific demographic characteristics. The ad content is concise and highlights anonymity and the research purpose to encourage participation. In addition, we use Random Digit Dialing (RDD) to contact older adults and residents in remote areas who may be less accessible online, ensuring their participation in the survey. To increase the completion rate, a small reward system is implemented, with one out of every 100 participants receiving a $5 to $10 incentive.

### Survey Platform: Google Forms and Phone Outreach

Google Forms is used as the primary data collection platform, enabling respondents to complete the survey on a computer or mobile device with ease. We have set Google Forms to restrict submissions to one per Google account to prevent duplicate responses. For those who may not have easy online access, telephone outreach will be conducted, especially targeting older adults and rural voters, to ensure the diversity and inclusivity of the sample.

### Data Validation: Post-Stratification Weighting

To ensure data quality, post-stratification weighting will be applied during the analysis phase based on demographic characteristics. This adjustment aligns the sample structure with the national voter distribution, reducing bias and increasing the accuracy of our findings. Multi-layered data validation measures enhance the reliability and representativeness of the results.

### Poll Aggregation: Multi-Wave Polling and Adjustments

To track changes in voter sentiment over time, we will conduct multiple waves of data collection and aggregation. The survey will be administered in multiple rounds throughout the election cycle, with each round spaced 3-4 weeks apart. Each wave of data will be collected and analyzed independently, then aggregated using weighted averages to smooth out single-instance fluctuations and help identify long-term trends, providing a reliable basis for predictions.

### Budget Allocation: Phased Spending and Testing

To maximize budget efficiency, we will use a phased spending strategy. An initial 30% of the advertising budget will be allocated to testing across platforms to determine effectiveness, with the remaining 70% directed to the most successful channels. The budget breakdown is as follows: social media advertising ($40,000) for broad and targeted outreach, phone outreach ($20,000) for RDD calls to less accessible populations, small rewards ($15,000) to encourage completion, and data cleaning and analysis ($25,000) for validation, weighting, and aggregation across multiple waves.
